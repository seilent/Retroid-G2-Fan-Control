# RpFanCtl

Custom fan control application for Retroid Pocket G2 devices.  
Potentially works for another devices, but need testing.  
It's pretty much vibe coded, so only serves as concept.  
  
Main benefit is you can set your own fan curve.  
Using standard mode while still having fan spins, or using performance mode without having jet engine running.  
DWYOR!
