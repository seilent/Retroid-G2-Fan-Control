# RpFanCtl

Custom fan control application for Retroid Pocket G2 devices.
It's pretty much vibe coded, so only serves as concept.  


## Do note by using this, it seems will break the stock fan control app

The quicksettings for the stock fan control app disappeared even after disabling magisk module. 
  
## Installation

### Via Magisk Module

1. Download the latest Magisk module zip
2. Flash in Magisk Manager
3. Reboot your device
4. Install apk and launch controller app
