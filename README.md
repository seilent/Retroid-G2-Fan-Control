# RpFanCtl

Custom fan control application for Retroid Pocket G2 devices.
It's pretty much vibe coded, so only serves as concept.  


## Do note by using this, it seems will break the stock fan control app

The quicksettings for the stock fan control app disappeared even after disabling magisk module. 
It might also because during experiementing, I ruined some of the system files. 
Please let me know if uninstalling the module also restores the stock fan control.

  
## Installation

### Via Magisk Module

1. Download the latest Magisk module zip
2. Flash in Magisk Manager
3. Reboot your device
4. Install apk and launch controller app
