# RpFanCtl

Custom fan control application for Retroid Pocket G2 devices.  
Potentially works for other retroid devices, but needs testing.  
It's pretty much vibe coded, so it only serves as a concept.  

The main benefit is that you can set your own fan curve.  
Use standard mode while still having the fan spin, or use performance mode without having a jet engine running.   
DWYOR!
